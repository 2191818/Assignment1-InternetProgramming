## Validating User Input
   Assuming we want to validate a user’s input from a text box. Let’s consider that the user enters a Canadian Zip code and we want to validate the entry.
*	 Add a Text field, with a Label “Enter a Zip Code:”, to the webpage
*	 Add a button, named “Validate”, to the webpage
*	 Write the JavaScript code that validates the user’s input when the Validate button is clicked
*	 Use the following regular expression: ^(?!.*[DFIOQU])[A-VXY][0-9][A-Z]●?[0-9][A-Z][0-9]$
   The structure of the Canadian Zipcode is explained here:
